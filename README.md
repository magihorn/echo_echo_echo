# Raspberry Pi Pico Sonar Visualizer
This is a project using LED's to visualize the distance to an object using an ultrasonic detector.  I built it for a project I did on echolocation.

You can build your own using:
1. A breadboard
2. Some wires
3. A [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17829)
4. [Raspberry Pi Pico Headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17907)
5. An [HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)
6. Some colorful LEDs
7. Some resistors

The Raspberry Pi Pico runs the main.py file using [MicroPython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html)
